# TP_DataMining

In TP2, we attempted to develop an algorithm that assigns each element to its own cluster directly, without providing the number of clusters. We then tested this algorithm on an existing cluttered dataset (IRIS, in our case) and compared our results with those of the means algorithm.


For TP3, we attempted to apply our algorithm to a new unclustered dataset. We retrieved the number of clusters from our algorithm and applied the k-means algorithm to the same dataset in order to compare our results with those of the means algorithm.


As a result, we can say that our algorithm provides the exact number of clusters, but it still needs to be improved when it comes to the number of elements in each cluster.
