# TP_DataMining

"In the first practical session, we attempted to develop an algorithm that assigns each element to its own cluster directly, without providing the number of clusters. We then tested this algorithm on an existing cluttered dataset (IRIS, in our case) and compared our results with those of the means algorithm."
